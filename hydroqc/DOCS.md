# Home Assistant Add-on : HydroQC

This addon will fetch the data available from your Hydro-Quebec account using your portal credentials and make the resulting data available to Home-Assistant via MQTT.\
You can find the source of the addon here: [https://gitlab.com/hydroqc/hydroqc-hass-addons](https://gitlab.com/hydroqc/hydroqc-hass-addons) \
More details and information on the sensors provided is available in the [project documentation](https://hydroqc.ca)
