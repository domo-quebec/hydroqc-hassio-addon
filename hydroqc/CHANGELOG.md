## v1.0.0-1

**Breaking:** Outage information is no longer available due to changes to Hydro-Québec's outage backend.
- hydroqc2mqtt: upgraded to [`1.0.0`](https://gitlab.com/hydroqc/hydroqc2mqtt/-/releases/1.0.0)

## v0.12.5-1

**Possible breaking change : The addon is no longer signed** CAS notary is no longer available and [Home-Assistant have yet to come up with an alternative](https://github.com/home-assistant/builder/issues/162) and we no longer have the original signin key for the add-on.
We don't know how Home-Assistant will react to an upgrade of the add-on from a signed version to an unsigned one. If you encounter any issues, copy your add-on configuration, uninstall the add-on and reinstall the latest version.

- add network capability to apparmor fix #27
- add check to see if a config file has been specified before adding envs !26
- we no longer build for 32bit platforms, installation on these platform will perform the builds locally

**Breaking Change**

This should have been mentioned in the previous release, sorry for the invonvenience.

With the addition of regular and high consumption rate in hourly consumption history for FlexD and Dual-Energy we had to rename the existing Hourly Consumption sensor to Total Hourly Consumption. You will need to update this in your energy dashboard and reimport the history if you want.
